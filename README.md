## Overview

This repository is a structured knowledge base and project hub dedicated to **systematic trading** and **quantitative finance**. It brings together foundational concepts, practical implementations, research workflows, and end-to-end trading projects, with the goal of bridging theory and real-world application.

The content here reflects both **learning-in-progress** and **hands-on experimentation**. It is designed to demonstrate how quantitative ideas are transformed into systematic, testable, and repeatable trading strategies.

## What This Repository Covers

### 1. Core Quantitative & Financial Concepts

This section focuses on building strong foundations, including:

- Market microstructure and price formation
- Returns, risk, and volatility modeling
- Statistical concepts (distributions, correlation, stationarity)
- Time-series analysis
- Portfolio construction and risk management principles

These concepts serve as the building blocks for all research and strategies in this repository.

---

### 2. Systematic Trading Strategies

A collection of **rule-based and data-driven strategies**, such as:

- Trend-following and momentum strategies
- Mean-reversion strategies
- Volatility-based and regime-aware strategies
- Signal generation using technical and statistical indicators
- Long/short portfolio construction

Each strategy emphasizes:

- Clear hypothesis formulation
- Explicit trading rules
- Position sizing and risk constraints
- Objective performance evaluation

---

### 3. Research & Experimentation

This repository also acts as a **quantitative research workspace**, covering:

- Feature engineering and signal research
- Backtesting methodologies and common pitfalls
- Rolling window analysis and EWMA techniques
- Event-driven analysis (e.g. macroeconomic releases)
- Robustness checks and sensitivity analysis

The focus is on developing **research discipline** and minimizing biases such as overfitting and look-ahead bias.

---

### 4. Projects & Case Studies

Included are **end-to-end quant and systematic trading projects**, typically involving:

- Data sourcing and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Strategy design and implementation
- Backtesting and performance attribution
- Risk metrics and drawdown analysis
- Clear documentation of assumptions and limitations

These projects are shared for **learning, discussion, and shared understanding**.

---

### 5. Tooling & Implementation

Where relevant, projects make use of:

- **Python** for research and strategy development
- Common quantitative libraries (`NumPy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, etc.)
- Modular, readable, and reproducible code structures
- Clear separation between data, signals, and execution logic

The emphasis is on **clarity, reproducibility, and extensibility** rather than black-box approaches.

---

## Philosophy

The guiding principles behind this repository are:

- **Systematic over discretionary** – rules before intuition
- **Research before results** – process matters more than outcomes
- **Risk-aware thinking** – returns are meaningless without context
- **Continuous learning** – strategies evolve as markets change
